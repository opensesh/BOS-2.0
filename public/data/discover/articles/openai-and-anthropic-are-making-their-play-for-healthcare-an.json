Morgan Healthcare Conference.OpenAI introduced **ChatGPT Health**, a consumer platform enabling patients to upload medical records and connect wellness apps for personalized health insights, alongside **OpenAI for Healthcare**, an enterprise suite targeting administrative burdens.Anthropic countered with **Claude for Healthcare**, a HIPAA-compliant toolkit integrating its Claude AI assistant with electronic health records, medical databases, and consumer health apps to serve patients, providers, payers, and life sciences researchers.The nearly simultaneous launches underscore both companies' strategic commitment to healthcare, a sector viewed as both a major opportunity and a high-stakes test for generative AI capabilities.",
