          "content": "Yoshi is positioned as the first premium matcha liqueur, a category‑defining spirit conceived to merge centuries‑old tea ritual with contemporary bar culture.Design studio Saint-Urbain developed the full brand world, from strategy and naming to packaging and motion, with the aim of honoring Japanese heritage without falling back on cliché.Visually, the brand rejects ornate craft‑spirits tropes in favor of chunky, icing‑like letterforms, ultra‑minimal layouts, and an opaque green bottle that lets matcha’s color become the hero.Early specialist coverage frames Yoshi as a bold, design‑led response to a liqueur aisle still rooted in decades‑old formulas.",
