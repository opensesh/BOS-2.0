The updates introduce **configurable templates built on design systems**, **direct video trimming**, and **plugin integrations** for tools like digital asset management and animation platforms. These features address common workflow friction points by keeping designers and marketers within Figma rather than forcing them to switch between multiple applications. According to Figma, the updates represent an initial step toward establishing Buzz as a unified workspace where creative teams can produce cohesive, high-impact branded content at scale.",

Video trimming eliminates the need for external editing tools, while plugin support connects popular platforms including Brandfolder, Lokalise, and LottieFiles directly to Figma. Together, these capabilities aim to reduce context-switching and accelerate the creation of social media posts, digital ads, and event promotion materials.",

The feature eliminates the need to synchronize multiple video durations across different platforms, a task that previously required jumping between Figma and separate video editing tools.
