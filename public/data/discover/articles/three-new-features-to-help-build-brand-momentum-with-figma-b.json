Within that lineup, video trimming in Buzz is framed as recognition that video is now central to modern campaigns—whether for social feeds, event pages, or animated ad units. Reporters note that marketers can now import clips, trim them to fit platform time limits, and sync multiple videos directly on the Buzz canvas instead of jumping into a separate editor. Figma’s newsroom materials characterize this as removing yet another layer of friction between creative iteration and final, shippable assets for performance and brand teams alike.",

Commentators say the three new features collectively move Buzz beyond simple template editing toward bulk, system-driven content creation that can scale to thousands of personalized variants. They also suggest that as more organizations centralize on Figma’s stack—using Sites for web, Draw for illustration, and Buzz for campaigns—the definition of a design system will increasingly encompass not just UI components but motion, language, and media rules. For brand and marketing leaders, that could make Buzz a crucial lever for turning static guidelines into a living, continuously executed brand presence.",
