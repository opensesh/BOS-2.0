          "content": "Beyond templates, the second pillar of the update is first‑class **plugin integration** inside Buzz, letting teams run tools for DAM, TMS, animation, and more directly in the marketing workspace. Figma’s announcements note that organizations can also build and publish internal plugins, effectively wiring their proprietary workflows—like regulated copy approvals or region‑specific asset feeds—straight into Buzz. Tech coverage of Figma’s 2025 product suite argues that this deeper plugin layer is what elevates Buzz from a template editor to part of a “one‑stack” content platform spanning design, sites, and marketing output. At the same time, native video trimming closes a key gap for social and campaign teams, who can now cut clips to length and sync them with other layouts inside the same file instead of exporting to a dedicated editor.",

Analysts point out that by centralizing translation, asset management, and lightweight motion work on top of brand‑linked templates, Buzz helps global brands keep multi‑language, multi‑channel campaigns aligned without adding new specialist software. Commentary from design‑systems experts suggests this is part of a larger trend: design platforms evolving into full‑stack content engines that govern everything from tokens to final ad creative. Looking ahead, they say the plugin layer and video support give Figma ample room to keep folding more marketing‑native capabilities into Buzz, further blurring the line between design system and everyday brand execution.",
