Figma emphasizes that organizations can also build internal-only plugins or share them with the wider Community, effectively encoding custom brand rules and workflows directly into the interface. On related solution pages, the company portrays this integration-first approach as part of a broader strategy to keep every touchpoint—from interactive demos to small-business websites—visually and behaviorally consistent with a single design system.",

Around the same period, Figma expanded its ChatGPT integration so users can generate Buzz assets via the Figma app inside ChatGPT, then open and refine them in Figma.

Coverage in design news aggregators echoes that positioning, presenting the three Buzz features as a response to teams that want Canva-like speed but with enterprise-grade design systems and governance. Looking ahead, investor and community channels suggest that tighter links between AI generation, design systems, and marketing surfaces like Buzz will shape Figma’s roadmap, even as regional rollouts and enterprise controls continue to evolve. For now, the trio of configurable templates, plugins, and video trimming marks Figma’s clearest bid yet to make Buzz a central hub for brand expression, not just another design surface.",
