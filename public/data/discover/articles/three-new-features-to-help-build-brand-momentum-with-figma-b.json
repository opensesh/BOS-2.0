Official guidance on creating marketing assets in Buzz walks through choosing or publishing templates, then customizing content for channels such as Instagram ads, illustrating how non‑designers can operate independently while staying within system rules. Third‑party explainers stress that this division of responsibilities—designers owning the system, marketers owning the message—reduces friction between teams that previously bounced files between tools like Canva and native design software. Agencies writing about Buzz argue that, when combined with responsive layouts and bulk creation features, system‑backed templates can materially increase campaign output without a proportional increase in design headcount.",

Web design and product‑news outlets describe the Buzz update as “three new features to help build brand momentum,” arguing that tighter design‑system integration, in‑product plugins, and native video controls make it easier for brands to move from concept to multichannel campaign without leaving Figma. Commentators note that this trajectory puts Figma in more direct competition with marketing‑centric tools by offering Canva‑like ease of use plus enterprise‑grade governance tied back to a single design system. Looking ahead, observers expect Buzz’s role to expand further as Figma layers in more AI‑assisted creation and deeper integrations, turning it into a central hub where brand, product, and marketing teams co‑create everything from static posts to motion‑rich campaigns.",
