Together with built-in video trimming, these changes signal Figma’s intent to compete more directly with Canva-style tools while leaning on its core strength: systematized, reusable design.",

Analysts say this extensibility is a key differentiator for Buzz, giving enterprises the control and integration depth they often miss in consumer-focused content tools.",

With configurable templates, plugins, and inline video control now in place, commentators expect Figma to continue deepening Buzz’s integrations and automation features, pushing closer to an end-to-end system for brand content creation and management.",
