According to Figma’s product notes, ChatGPT can produce multi-slide layouts that reflect the structure of a conversation—such as problem, insights, proposal, and roadmap—while users refine content and styling iteratively in chat. Tech coverage of the broader app rollout highlights Figma as one of the flagship creative tools in ChatGPT, alongside Canva and Spotify, that demonstrate how conversational prompts can trigger complex app workflows behind the scenes. Tutorials show that once the Figma app is invoked, users can chain tasks—first diagramming a product strategy, then converting that logic into a client-ready slide deck—without leaving the ChatGPT thread.",

Recent Figma AI updates—like on-canvas background removal, object isolation, and image expansion—further reduce the need to jump between Photoshop-style editors and presentation tools, especially when combined with ChatGPT’s text generation. Marketing and content teams can now scale localized campaigns and personalized visuals far faster, as ChatGPT handles messaging while Figma templates the look and feel. Experts note that this is less about flashy “type-a-prompt, get-an-image” tricks and more about shaving friction from everyday workflows like editing images, laying out slides, and maintaining consistent visual systems.",

Looking ahead, both companies signal more capabilities on the way, from richer slide-generation features in Figma to broader availability of ChatGPT apps across regions and enterprise environments. As monetization and discovery mature, observers expect a wave of niche creative and productivity apps to follow Figma’s lead, turning ChatGPT into a central dashboard for planning, designing, and presenting work.",
