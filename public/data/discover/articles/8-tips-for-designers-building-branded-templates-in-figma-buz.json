Buzz connects these component sets directly to design systems, meaning properties like layout, size, or whether a logo appears can be toggled via simple dropdowns or switches. Designers can then add template guidelines—locking critical elements such as logos or brand patterns while leaving body copy and imagery editable—to create guardrails rather than roadblocks. This balance lets collaborators quickly choose the right layout for Instagram, LinkedIn, or a one-pager while staying firmly within brand parameters.",

Official help docs advise planning a locking strategy up front, typically fixing logos and core visual elements while allowing flexible fields like descriptions, speaker names, and calls to action. When teammates open a template, they land in focused editing mode, where they can swap content without disturbing the underlying layout, variants, or constraints. If they need more freedom, they can explicitly remove those guidelines and switch into a freer design environment, but the default experience keeps most users on-brand.",

New Buzz capabilities such as configurable template sets, plugin access, and video trimming further expand what these templates can handle—from localized variants to richer media. As third-party guides and agencies start ranking and remixing the best Figma templates, designers are increasingly treating Buzz templates as reusable “digital building blocks” that sit on top of design systems. Looking ahead, organizations that invest early in these eight practices are likely to see faster production cycles, fewer off-brand one-offs, and stronger alignment between design and marketing teams.",
