Key practices include structuring designs thoughtfully, using auto layout for responsiveness, and separating text layers to support bulk creation from CSV or XLSX files. These tips ensure templates adapt to variable content like longer headlines without misalignment, while descriptive layer names such as \"Event Title\" or \"CTA Button Text\" guide users on formatting.",
