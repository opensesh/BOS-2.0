          "content": "Figma’s official “8 Tips for Designers Building Branded Templates in Figma Buzz” lays out a blueprint for creating self‑serve marketing assets that flex for real content while keeping brand elements locked down.The guidance centers on using Auto Layout for responsive behavior, separating text layers for each input, and leaning on components and variants so non‑designers can safely customize layouts.Figma positions Buzz as a dedicated space where designers publish these brand‑controlled templates, then set clear editing guardrails via template guidelines and locking strategies.The goal, Figma says, is to help teams create “assets at scale” that stay on brand without sending every request back to the design team.",
