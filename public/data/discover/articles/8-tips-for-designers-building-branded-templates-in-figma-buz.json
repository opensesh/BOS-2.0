Designers should configure auto layout to maintain proper spacing and alignment when text expands, images change proportions, or content volumes fluctuate unexpectedly. This approach prevents common template failures where lengthy headlines disrupt layout or image resizing causes distortion. By establishing flexible spacing rules upfront, designers ensure templates accommodate real-world content variations that marketing teams will inevitably encounter.",

This integration eliminates the need to create numerous static template variations, streamlining both the design process and user experience.",

Rather than generic labels like \"Text 1\" or \"Image 2,\" designers should name layers specifically such as \"Event Title,\" \"CTA Button Text,\" or \"Speaker Photo\" to communicate the intended content type. Including example text with formatting guidance—such as \"Date of Event (e.g., July 10, 2025)\"—helps marketers understand proper content formatting and maintains consistency across outputs. Strategic layer separation enables the bulk creation feature, which maps CSV data fields to individual layers for generating multiple branded assets simultaneously.",
