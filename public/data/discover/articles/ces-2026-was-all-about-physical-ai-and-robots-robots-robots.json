Commentaries emphasized that leading electronics brands now talk about home robots and smart appliances as long‑lived AI endpoints that must gain capabilities after purchase, not depreciate like traditional hardware. This framing aligns with arguments that physical devices should be treated as vessels for evolving services, with updates, data and subscriptions underpinning long‑term value. Together, these trends suggest robotics is being repositioned less as a niche category and more as a core delivery vehicle for next‑generation AI experiences.",

Market researchers argued that this convergence lets vendors amortize massive AI training costs across robots and robotaxis, which helps make ambitious deployments — from factory humanoids to urban ride‑hailing fleets — more financially plausible. At the same time, analysts highlighted a surge of Chinese robotics players on the show floor, describing a “quantity offensive” in humanoids and dexterous hands that is reshaping competitive dynamics. These developments contributed to a growing sense among industry leaders that physical AI is becoming a strategic arena in which national and corporate ambitions directly collide.",

Commentators drew parallels with the IoT wave, warning that without durable subscription models, robust maintenance networks and clear user value, many robotics concepts could struggle once the spotlight of CES fades. Others countered that the depth of investment from chipmakers, auto groups and electronics giants indicates a longer‑term structural shift, not just a passing fad. What most observers agreed on is that, after CES 2026, AI will increasingly be judged not only by what it can say or generate on screen, but by what it can safely and usefully do in the physical world.",
