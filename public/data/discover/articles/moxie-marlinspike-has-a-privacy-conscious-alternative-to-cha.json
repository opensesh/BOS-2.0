Confer processes AI computations on cloud servers while ensuring user inputs, outputs, and keys remain inaccessible to the provider through Trusted Execution Environments and protected hardware. This launch addresses growing concerns over AI data exposure, where mainstream tools like ChatGPT store logs even after deletion, as seen in a May 2025 court order.",
