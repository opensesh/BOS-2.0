The new identity simplifies the name to \"The Huntington\" and features a pared-back **'H' monogram** with stylized pillars flanking a gem-like center, replacing an ornate botanical-heavy version. This positions the institution as a \"hidden gem\" rooted in California yet framed for global appeal, emphasizing unity across its library, art, and gardens.",
