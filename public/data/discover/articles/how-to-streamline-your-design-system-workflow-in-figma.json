A full rewrite of its design systems architecture now makes actions like updating variables or switching modes 30–60% faster, with heavy state swaps dropping from 3500ms to 350ms in some cases.New authoring tools, including a fullscreen variables modal and drag‑and‑drop reordering of modes and collections without breaking IDs, directly target long‑standing workflow bottlenecks for design system teams.Together with responsive layout enhancements and hidden power features like Smart Selection and conditional prototyping, the updates position Figma as a faster, more resilient foundation for systematized product design.",
