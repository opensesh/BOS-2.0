These features allow designers to remove unwanted elements, separate subjects for repositioning or effects, and extend image backgrounds to new aspect ratios without exporting to external apps like Photoshop. The tools emphasize precision through improved lasso selection and operate without text prompts, targeting granular edits common in design workflows.",
