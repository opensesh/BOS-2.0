Designers can now move from rough layout to production-ready visuals in a single environment, which is especially useful when stakeholders ask to “just remove that object” or “make this hero wider” during live reviews. Figma’s AI tooling is also designed to minimize prompt-heavy workflows, favoring direct manipulation on the canvas so that users can rely on visual intuition rather than crafting text instructions. This approach reflects a broader trend in design software toward assistive AI that augments familiar workflows instead of replacing them with opaque generative pipelines.",

Commentators argue that Figma’s differentiation lies less in the algorithms themselves and more in how tightly they are integrated into collaborative design workflows, cutting out the export–edit–reimport loop that has long frustrated teams. Marketers and product teams stand to benefit in particular: they can experiment with variations, clean up assets, and localize visuals without depending on specialists in separate tools for every minor change. At the same time, Figma is weaving these edits into a broader AI ecosystem that includes image generation and no-code app-building, signaling ambitions beyond wireframing and prototyping.",

As AI image tools become standard in design software, Figma will be judged on how accurately its models handle complex scenes, preserve brand consistency, and respect enterprise governance expectations around AI usage. Observers expect further convergence between generative and editing features, where teams can both create and refine assets without leaving Figma, potentially reducing the role of standalone editors to niche or high-end retouching tasks. For now, the launch of Erase object, Isolate object, and Expand image marks a significant step in Figma’s effort to keep designers working—and editing—where collaboration already happens.",
