Object removal and isolation also mean performance teams can test different focal points or layouts—such as shifting a product to make space for copy—without opening a separate creative ticket. Commentators argue that this kind of in‑file, context‑aware editing effectively turns Figma from a prototyping surface into a fuller production hub for visual assets.",

          "content": "Analysts point out that rivals like Adobe and Canva have offered object removal and background expansion features for several years, making Figma’s move an important step in closing a perceived feature gap. At the same time, Figma is deliberately steering away from prompt‑driven generative imagery, emphasizing granular, selection-based editing controls instead. Commentators contrast this with standalone generative models, noting that while those tools excel at creating new scenes, Figma is targeting the more prosaic but critical work of refining assets for production use. The launch also arrives amid a broader platform race to embed AI directly where users work, including recent moves to expose creative features inside conversational interfaces.",

          "content": "Looking ahead, observers expect Figma to extend these AI image capabilities across more of its ecosystem, potentially deepening ties between design, collaboration, and implementation tools. As organizations standardize on Figma for product and experience design, built‑in precision editing could reduce reliance on separate creative suites for all but the most advanced retouching. Experts say this may shift how teams structure workflows, with more image decisions happening during live design reviews rather than in downstream production phases. Ultimately, the update signals Figma’s intent to compete not by out‑generating AI art platforms, but by owning the practical, everyday editing tasks that shape how digital products and campaigns actually ship.",
