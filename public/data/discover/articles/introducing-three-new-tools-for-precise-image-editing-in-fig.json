These features enable precise edits like removing unwanted elements, separating subjects for adjustments such as lighting or blur, and extending backgrounds to new aspect ratios without distortion or exports to tools like Photoshop. Available immediately to Professional, Organization, and Enterprise plan users with AI enabled, they consolidate with existing options like Remove background and Crop for streamlined workflows.",
