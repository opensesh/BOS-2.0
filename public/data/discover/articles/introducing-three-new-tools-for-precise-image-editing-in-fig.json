The launch complements Figma’s existing AI offerings, from automated layer renaming and content generation to image background removal, positioning the platform as an increasingly AI-first design environment.",

Weavy’s approach of pairing leading generative models with professional editing controls mirrors the balance Figma is striking between automation and precise, hands-on adjustments. As Figma rolls out the new image editing tools to more products beyond Design and Draw, the company is expected to deepen this integration, giving teams a continuous path from AI generation to detailed, object-level refinement.",
