          "content": "The **Erase object** tool allows designers to select and remove unwanted elements from images using an improved lasso selection method, which Figma refined to provide precision control. When objects are moved or removed, the surrounding image retains its original characteristics, preventing visual inconsistencies in backgrounds, colors, and textures. The **Isolate object** feature enables users to separate a subject from its background, allowing them to move the isolated element or apply individual effects such as blur, lighting adjustments, shadow modifications, color shifts, or focus changes. **Expand image** extends an image's background to fit new aspect ratios, solving a common problem in multi-format campaign creation where a single product shot needs adaptation for web banners, mobile displays, and social media without distortion.",

          "content": "The consolidated toolbar surfaces background removal as a primary action, acknowledging that removing backgrounds is among the most frequently performed tasks on Figma's platform. By centralizing these tools in one accessible location, designers eliminate the traditional workflow of exporting assets to specialized software, making edits, and reimporting files—a process that introduces delays and context switching. The AI-powered approach does not rely on text prompts or generative models, distinguishing Figma's offering from purely generative tools like Nano Banana and focusing instead on practical, user-directed editing control. This design philosophy makes the tools accessible to creative teams of varying skill levels, reducing dependencies on specialized expertise for routine visual adjustments.",

          "content": "Competitors Adobe and Canva have offered object removal capabilities for several years, positioning Figma's launch as a necessary catch-up effort rather than innovation. However, Figma's integration of these tools directly into the design canvas without requiring prompt engineering represents a different approach focused on contextual, in-workflow editing. Industry analysts at ContentGrip highlight the practical implications for marketing and design teams: \"Erase and Isolate object remove the need to ping the design team for every background cleanup or object reposition,\" enabling faster turnaround on campaign variations and reducing organizational bottlenecks. The simultaneous announcement of similar features within ChatGPT underscores a broader competitive landscape where creative software vendors are embedding AI capabilities into established design environments.",

By enabling contextual editing directly within design mockups, Figma reduces the back-and-forth cycles common in cross-functional reviews where stakeholders want to visualize small adjustments before finalizing assets. For B2B marketers and brand managers, the tools unlock measurable efficiency gains in creative production, particularly when managing performance marketing tests that require rapid asset variations. Figma's positioning of these updates as part of its broader 2025 feature set—which includes 150+ additions across drawing, prototyping, and collaboration tools—reinforces the platform's evolution toward a full-stack visual design environment.",
