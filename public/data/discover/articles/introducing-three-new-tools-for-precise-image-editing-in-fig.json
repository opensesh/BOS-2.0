Analysts point out that performance marketers and content teams can now erase distractions or reposition objects themselves, cutting down on design tickets for background cleanup or simple compositional changes. That shift enables what some observers call “design‑stage optimization,” where stakeholders propose edits directly in live mockups instead of waiting for new asset rounds. For B2B marketers and brand managers in particular, this can translate into faster testing cycles, tighter control over visual consistency, and fewer dependencies on specialist photo editors for everyday work.",

Commentators note that rivals have offered object removal and background expansion features for years, framing this release as Figma closing a long‑standing gap in raster editing rather than leapfrogging the market. The launch landed the same day Adobe announced similar AI image-editing capabilities inside ChatGPT, underscoring how vendors are racing to embed AI wherever designers already work. At the same time, experts say Figma is differentiating itself by emphasizing precise, prompt‑free controls tuned to interface design and marketing workflows instead of open‑ended image generation.",

Analysts suggest this deepening toolset could strengthen platform lock‑in: as Figma becomes capable of handling both layout and common photo edits, teams have fewer reasons to rely on external suites for day‑to‑day production. Enterprise adoption may hinge on how Figma addresses governance questions around AI enablement, given that access is currently restricted to paying customers with AI turned on. But if the features continue to mature, observers expect them to become baseline expectations in collaborative design tools, much like background removal has over the past few years.",
