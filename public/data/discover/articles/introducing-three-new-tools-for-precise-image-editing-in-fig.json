These features integrate into a revamped image editing toolbar alongside existing options such as Crop and Remove background, streamlining workflows for marketers and creative teams. The tools prioritize granular control without requiring text prompts, addressing common pain points in refining visuals for UI mockups, campaigns, and product shots.",
