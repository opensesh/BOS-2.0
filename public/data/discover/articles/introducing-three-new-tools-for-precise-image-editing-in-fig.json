These features, announced in December 2025, integrate directly into the Figma canvas, allowing users to perform precision edits without relying on text prompts or jumping between applications. The tools represent a significant step forward in reducing workflow friction, particularly for teams managing visual assets across multiple formats and platforms.",

The consolidated toolbar prioritizes the Remove background option prominently, reflecting its status as one of the most frequently used actions on the platform. This design philosophy positions Figma's approach as fundamentally different from generative models, which excel at creation but lack the granular editing precision that design teams need for asset optimization.",
