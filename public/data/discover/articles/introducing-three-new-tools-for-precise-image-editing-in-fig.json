These tools integrate with existing features such as Remove background and Crop into a unified toolbar for quicker access, prioritizing high-use actions like background removal. Available in Figma Design and Figma Draw for Professional, Organization, and Enterprise plans with AI enabled, they emphasize granular control without text prompts.",
