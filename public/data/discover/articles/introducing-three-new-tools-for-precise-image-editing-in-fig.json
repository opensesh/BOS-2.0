These features enable designers to remove unwanted elements, extract and reposition subjects while preserving lighting and texture, and extend image edges for new aspect ratios without distortion. The tools join existing capabilities like Remove background and Crop, reducing the need to export to Photoshop or Canva for routine fixes.",
