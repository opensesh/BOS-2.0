          "content": "Figma’s December 2025 post “Hard problems are still hard: A story about the tools that change and the work that doesn’t” captures a growing sentiment across tech: artificial intelligence is transforming workflows, but not dissolving the underlying difficulty of the work itself.In that piece, Figma product manager Nikolas Klein recounts building new AI-powered image editing tools and concludes that even with powerful models, core design challenges like judgment, trade‑offs, and context remain stubbornly human.A similar refrain appears in robotics coverage, where commentators note that as agentic AI systems spread through automation and manufacturing, they intensify long‑standing problems of planning, safety, and integration rather than resolving them.Together these perspectives frame a 2025 reality in which tools change quickly, yet the hardest problems in software, design, and robotics continue to resist easy fixes.",

A Robotics.ee archive for October highlights ongoing work on planetary exploration robots and emphasizes that coping with uncertainty—noisy sensors, unpredictable terrain, and limited communication—is a core, unsolved challenge despite better hardware and algorithms.Another Robotics.ee piece from December, based on interviews with autonomous vehicle safety staff, describes how teams still struggle to manage and share safety data effectively, suggesting that organizational and socio‑technical hurdles remain as stubborn as purely technical ones.A Manning chapter on LLM limits reinforces this picture by noting that while models can aid code generation and high‑level reasoning in robotics stacks, they do not magically solve long‑horizon control or formal safety verification, where guarantees and rigorous testing are still required.",

Across these domains, the message is consistent: new tools, from robot sensors to generative agents, can change who does which part of the work and how quickly, but the deepest problems of safety, coordination, and judgment remain as hard as ever.",
