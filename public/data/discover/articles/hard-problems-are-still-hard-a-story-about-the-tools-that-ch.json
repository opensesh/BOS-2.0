Their surveys show deep skepticism about near‑term humanoid robots in elder care or domestic chores, with only small minorities of experts expecting such systems to be ready soon, despite intense investment. At the same time, investors are looking for “industrial robotic leapfrogging” and lab automation plays, betting that focused, structured environments can yield real gains even as general‑purpose autonomy lags.Across these domains, the message is consistent: new AI agents, digital twins, and better simulation pipelines help, but they run into the same old walls of physics, safety standards, and economic viability that have defined robotics for years.",

Commentaries on “agentic AI in the enterprise” argue that most failed pilots stem not from weak models but from underestimating integration complexity, governance, and the need for human judgment in high‑stakes decisions. Educational material on large language models similarly warns that computational limits and S‑curves of diminishing returns mean many NP‑hard and real‑world planning problems will not be “solved” by scale alone, even if subsets become more tractable. Security podcasts and industry blogs extend the lesson further, showing how vulnerabilities in mature ecosystems like Kubernetes and the wider open‑source stack keep surfacing, underscoring that better tools can shift where the work happens—but not the fact that someone still has to wrestle with the hard parts.",
