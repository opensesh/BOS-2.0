The update, launched in early January 2026, introduces the tagline \"Live Life Energised\" to shift messaging from transactional details like rates to emotional aspiration, positioning energy as a life enabler. This builds on the agency's original 2020 branding work amid a competitive market dominated by the Big Six utilities.",
